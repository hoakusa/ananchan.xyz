        <h3>My name is An Pham. I DESIGN & BUILD web and mobile products.</h3>

        <!-- <p>My story starts on the first day of studying Information Technology at Oulu University of Applied Sciences. In the first 2 years, I was completely wrapped up in coding so much that I have thought of becoming a web developer or Software Engineer. Coding was like my morning coffee untill May, 2015. It was the time once I started my intership at Suprview Oy. Here, my common task is related to sketching wireframes, designing User Flow, User Interface for applications. Inspiring by the passion it brought up, I wholly changed my mind and determined to be a designer.</p> -->

        <p>As an interaction designer, I strongly believe that a proper design must help product developers to be able to understand all the ins and outs of the process. Based on it, they will build up a successful product that is comfortable and easy to use.</p>

        <p>Moreover, I am also a Frontend developer, who strive to make web a beautiful place with every line of codes.</p>

        <p>I firmly believe that Design is not only a work, a process, but it is a colorful game in which the interaction designer is the storyteller who creates this world.</p>
